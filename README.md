<h2 id="landing">Landing Page 🛩️</h2>


<p>When first loading the URL for Augmented Retail, you are taken to a landing page with the logo, a site title and a navigation bar. The navigation bar has options to Login, Sign Up, or to view a list of current products. You can also see a cart icon which will keep track of any products you wish to purchase. Below are images for the landing page, sign up, and login.<p>
