## Description 
    
Augmented Retail, an eCommerce store that harnesses the power of augmented reality inside the web browser.

Augmented Retail provides a seamless transition for the user who wants to get a closer look at an online product with AR.

How it works? Simple. The user clicks a link and is taken to a page that renders a 3D object using their camera to view in their environment.

## Usage

Clicking a link on the product page will open up AR functionality in your web browser.

For now, we are having the user scan the below marker for the AR model anchor.

In future updates, it is our goal to develop a non-marker based model renderer for this project.
